# Galatic Mining Club-v1-whitepaper

Creating a green sustainable stream of assets for ecosystems and individuals.
Nfts are more sooo much more then jpegs.

Introduction
Cryptocurrency mining is the competitive process that verifies and adds new transactions to the blockchain for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-work (PoW) method. The miner that is selected is rewarded with some amount of the currency and/or transaction fees. Currently, there is a stigma that cryptocurrency mining is harmful to the environment due to its high energy requirement and powerful computers needed to process transactions.

POS or proof of stake is another way of validateing networks. Im this system users stake tokens to to receive yeild. You stake your tokene with a validator node. Validators receive  a portion of the stakeing rewards for running nodes. To befome a profitable validator on some networks can be very expensive. Along with start up cost there is also a lot monthly expenses to run a secure reliable validator node. Some networks also have a minimum stakeing amount. This mean you must be in the top 100 validator acording to amount of tokens staked  (numbers vary on different ecosystems) to actually receive commissions for running your validator. 

G.M.C. is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that mines PoW cryptocurrencies and host validator nodes on various ecosystems. Owning a Galactic Miner Nft will give you access to rewards and airdrops from mulitple ecosystems, and the ability to vote on club proposals. Proposals will be made by a council of trusted nft holders.

Mining and validator rewards will be sent to a multi-chain wallet where they will be converted to various cryptos depending on the block chain and preference of our holders. From this wallet, the funds will be distributed to the treasury wallet. The treasury will hold 10% of monthly profits to expand operations, and invest in future projects.  A set percentage of native tokens that can be staked will be to help secure the ecosystem. All remaining funds will be sent to a community wallet and distributed according to a community vote.

All assets bought by the DAO will be 100% owned by the NFT holders. All rights to any miners purchased by the DAO belong to the NFT holders. If a holder chooses to sell their NFT, they sell their right to vote in the Galatic Mining Club in addition to any other benefits that NFT comes with.
Mission
Nomad Miner’s mission is to help unite multiple blockchains in a way that is beneficial to all ecosystems, protocols, and individuals. Every blockchain has strengths and weaknesses. We use an ecosystems strongest attributes to support other ecosystems that may be need help or assistance in that same area, For example  we can bring more liquidity to the ecosystem and provide a new source of passive income for individuals and protocols, And individuals.This project allows the community to reap the benefits of a crypto mining operation without maintenance, Our process in helpful to all of the crypto market. The POW block chains get added security and become more decentralized and secure . The POS block chains receive a new source liquidity helping fight token inflation and providing a source of passive income.  At the same time we can will be helping all of crypto be a more environmentally friendly and sustainable ecosystem where POW and POS block chains live in harmony complimenting the needs of the other. We will continue to seek new ways to unite ecosystems in unique ways that benefit the future of blockchain technology.

Crypto trilemma- decentralization, security , and ad scaleability. The crypto trilemma is arguably the biggest problem that needs to be solved in order to get blockchain technologies massively adopted. The crypto trilemma ultimately means developers have to sacrifice one area in order to accommodate the othe two areas. This is why we belive the future of crypto is multi chain. Where ecosystems can use other ecosystems strengths to accommodate their own weaknesses. This would allow ecosystems to focus on perfecting what that individual ecosystem are good at, while other entire ecosystems focus on improving the weaknesses. The Galatic Mining Club is focused on bringing ecosystems together in new ways that will ultimately be beneficial to individuals, protocols, and ecosystems.

How it Works (Voting)
All voting will take place at the end of each month. Holders will vote on

For early supporters of the project, we will be launching a separate collection called Miner Cards. These collectors will give the holder 2 votes for each miner card in every DAO poll. Miner Card holders will automatically be whitelisted for the Galatic Mining mint. Miner Card holder will also receive 10% of the Galactic miner NFT sales in addition to eligibility to receive special airdrops. 
●	Miner Card = 2 DAO votes
●	Galatic Mining NFT = 1 DAO vote

* A wallet holds 1x Miner Card and 1x Galatic Mining NFT will have a total of three vote in any DAO poll.

Payouts
I’f and when the DAO votes to pay out holders we will be creating smart contracts utilizing multiple dexs to offer out holders Preferred % payouts
Ex. If a holder wants there portfolio to consist of 
25%bitcoin
25%osmosis 
25% atom
25% stable coins
That is how they will receive there payouts. The coins available for Preferred % program will vary according to the ecosystem we are building on.

Roadmap
1.	Relocate the dao to an ecosystem where we begin our mission to unite all blockchains 
2.	Early supporters nft launch 
3.	Create smart contracts. Update website to show facility stats with access only to holders.
4.	Enable preferred % payouts to holders.
Grow the treasury big enough to offer nft collateralized loans . That can be paid back with future mining profits.

5.	Create a diverse portfolio of liquidity that will help the ecosystem grow.





Long-Term Vision
The Galatic Mining Club number one goal is bring extrernal value into ecosystems to help sustain a healthy growing environment in ways that will help the community and ecosystem thrive together.
