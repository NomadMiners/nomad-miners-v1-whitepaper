How nomads plan to unite and help the entire crypto market


Introduction
Cryptocurrency mining is the competitive process that verifies and adds new transactions to the blockchain for a cryptocurrency that uses the proof-of-work (PoW) method. The miner that is selected is rewarded with some amount of the currency and/or transaction fees. Currently, there is a stigma that cryptocurrency mining is harmful to the environment due to its high energy requirement and powerful computers needed to process transactions.

Nomad Miners is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that mines PoW cryptocurrencies and shares the profits generated with nomad Miner’s NFT holders all managed by smart contracts. All mining profits will be sent to a multi-chain wallet where they will be converted to various cryptos depending on the block chain and preference of our holders. From this wallet, the funds will be distributed to the Luna Miner’s treasury wallet. The treasury will hold 10% of monthly profits to minimize environmental footprint, expand mining operations, and invest in future projects. All remaining funds will be sent to a community wallet and distributed accordingly to the community vote.

All assets bought by the DAO will be 100% owned by the NFT holders. All rights to any miners purchased by the DAO belong to the NFT holders. If a holder chooses to sell their NFT, they sell their right to vote in the Luna Miner DAO in addition to any other benefits that NFT comes with.

Mission
Nomad Miner’s mission is to help unite multiple blockchains in a way that is beneficial to all ecosystems, protocols, and individuals. Every blockchain has strengths and weaknesses. We use an ecosystems strongest attributes to support other ecosystems that may be need help or assistance in that same area, For example  we can bring more liquidity to the ecosystem and provide a new source of passive income for individuals and protocols, And individuals.This project allows the community to reap the benefits of a crypto mining operation without maintenance, Our process in helpful to all of the crypto market. The POW block chains get added security and become more decentralized and secure . The POS block chains receive a new source liquidity helping fight token inflation and providing a source of passive income.  At the same time we can will be helping all of crypto be a more environmentally friendly and sustainable ecosystem where POW and POS block chains live in harmony complimenting the needs of the other. We will continue to seek new ways to unite ecosystems in unique ways that benefit the future of blockchain technology.

Crypto trilemma- decentralization, security , and ad scaleability. The crypto trilemma is arguably the biggest problem that needs to be solved in order to get blockchain technologies massively adopted. The crypto trilemma ultimately means developers have to sacrifice one area in order to accommodate the othe two areas. This is where why we belive the future of crypto is multi chain. Where ecosystems can use other ecosystems strengths to accommodate their own weaknesses. This would allow ecosystems to focus on perfecting what that individual ecosystem is good at, while other entire ecosystems focus on improving the weaknesses. Nomad miners DAO is focused on bringing ecosystems in new ways that will ultimately be beneficial to individuals, protocols, and ecosystems.

How it Works (Voting)
All voting will take place at the end of each month. We will be integrating Gravi DAO’s technology into our project to ensure all voting is done fairly and securely. This system will ensure all nomad Miner’s polls are conducted fairly.

For early supporters of the project, we will be launching a separate collection called Miner Cards. These collectors will give the holder 2 votes for each miner card in every DAO poll. Miner Card holders will automatically be whitelisted for the Luna Miners NFT mint. Miner Card holder will also receive 10% of the Luna Miner NFT sales in addition to eligibility to receive special airdrops. 
●	Miner Card = 2 DAO votes
●	Nomad Miner NFT = 1 DAO vote

* A wallet holds 1x Miner Card and 1x Nomad Miner NFT will have a total of three vote in any DAO poll.

Payouts
I’f and when the DAO votes to pay out holders we will be creating smart contracts utilizing multiple dexs to offer out holders Preferred %payouts
Ex. If a holder wants there portfolio to consist of 
25%bitcoin
25%osmosis 
25% atom
25% stable coins
That is how they will receive there payouts. The coins available for Preferred % program will vary according to the ecosystem we are building on.




NFT Utility

* Profit distribution model, treasury percentages, and royalties will be permanent and cannot be changed by Luna Miners DAO voting.

NFT Sale
Proceeds from the Miner Card sale will be to used to finance to the project. The funds will be used to purchase Luna Miner’s first miners  to start generating revenue. Remaining funds will be used to develop website, discord, smart contracts, and salaries to further develop the project.

Funds from the Luna Miner NFT sale will allocated to the following:
●	60% - Buy high powered crypto miners. These miners will be used to boost the profits the Luna Miners DAO. The profits produced will ensure the Luna Miner DAO is positioned to scale quickly and efficiently on a monthly basis.
●	10% - Invested into green technology such as solar power to offset the energy usage produced by the facility.
●	10% - Shared with early partners  and to assist projects being built on the  ecosystem .
●	5% - Shared to wallets holding a Miner Card.
●	5% - Shared to Angel Protocol to support a charity of the Luna Miner DAO’s choice.
●	10%- Project creator(s).

* Project creators will receive a 4% royalty anytime a Luna Miner NFT or Luna Miner Card is sold. This will be dedicated to further expand the project.

Roadmap
1.	Relocate the dao to an ecosystem where we begin our mission to unite all blockchains 
2.	Early supporters nft launch 
3.	Create smart contracts. Update website to show facility stats with access only to holders.
4.	Enable preferred %payouts to holders.
Grow the treasury big enough to offer nft collateralized loans . That can be paid back with future mining profits.

5.	Spread  nomad miners across multiple blockchains continue out mission





Long-Term Vision
Nomad Miners is looking to build a sustainable, decentralized ecosystem and mining facility that offsets the energy requirements with green technology. Luna Miners aims to utilize solar power and other green technologies to offset electricity costs and electricity generated from the facility. In addition to this, the heat the miners will also be repurposed for environmentally sound purposes. By minting a Luna Miner NFT or Luna Miner Card, you will be helping decentralize and secure multiple ecosystems, proving mining can be environmentally sound. 

After loosing most of our funds set aside to build our project in the collapse of terra luna, where we were originally building we realized how important diversification is and not being a maxi to any one chain. But rather to bring all chains together helping eachother grow and  thrive while getting one step closer to solving the crypto dillema decentralization ,security, and scalability  by working together as one movement towards a better more decentralized future.
